# RTNIx
Examples and helper classes for usage of the RTNI-package

This code was created for the Bachelor thesis 'Fidelities of output states of noisy quantum circuits via tensor networks' by Jacob Widmann under supervisor professor Robert KÃ¶nig of the Technical univeristy of munich. For usage follow the installation instruction of the RTNI-package, than copy the python files (.py and .ipynb) in the PYTHON-folder, and the Data-folder together with the FidelityPlots.nb file in the Mathematika folder. In the Data-folder are some precomputed fidelities, and in the mathematika file are some fidelity plots.
This programm was written on Linux. For usage on windows, you might have to change some filepathing in the code.
